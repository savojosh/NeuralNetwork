# Base Neural Network

---

~~The training of neural networks (provided by the Trainer.java abstract class) is centered around population-based training (PBT). Population-based training, in summary, acts as a hybrid approach merging the random search and hand-tuning methods. This is accomplished by having a population of neural networks, each with random hyperparameters (mimicking the random search method), are run through a set of test data. From there, the highest scoring neural networks are kept while the others are replaced by clones of the highest scoring neural networks with variations added to them.~~
my own theory instead of this ^

P.S. Some notable videos that I watched to introduce me to and better understand the general concepts of neural networks are below:
- Gave me example problems to solve using the neural network. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c
- Provides a real neat abstraction using a piece of paper. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5xKayCBOeU
- Helped with understanding the key concepts behind neural networks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piF6D6CQxUw
- The math. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU
- Explains neural networks in really basic terms. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqOfi41LfDw
