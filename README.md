# Base Neural Network

## v1.0.0

---

This project contains a Network.java and Layer.java file for the source code. These two files are made to be versatile and fit to any need.

I did not, however, create a Trainer.java or Generation.java or the likes because that can vary widely depending on the need, but this is on the list for future updates to this project.

One question that may be raised, "why Java as opposed to, for example, Python?" The answer: organization. Although it would be more efficient and allow for easier interactions with a Python data mining application, it made more sense conceptually in my head writing it in Java. This, however, may too be another possible update to this project (conversion from Java to Python) at some point in the future.

Going away from future plans for this project, the data folder contains an "EXAMPLE-Network_001." This folder does not contain a network, but rather exemplifies how the save files are structured.

P.S. Some notable videos that I watched to better understand neural networks are below:

- Gave me example problems to solve using the neural network.

- Provides a real neat abstraction using a piece of paper.

- Helped with understanding the key concepts behind neural networks.
